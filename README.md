ðŸ“Š **Inflation Forecasting Using Regression Analysis**
This project analyzes and forecasts **core inflation** in India using historical macroeconomic data and linear regression techniques in Microsoft Excel. It explores the dynamics of headline vs. core inflation, underlying economic drivers, and policy responses, and provides a forecasted inflation value based on GDP growth estimates.

ðŸ§© **Key Components**
ðŸ“Œ **Conceptual Coverage:**
1. Headline vs. Core Inflation
2. Demand-pull and Cost-push inflation
3. Business cycle and inflation dynamics
4. Impact of inflation on employment and economic stability

ðŸ“ˆ **Data Analysis:**
1. Historical data on CPI, WPI, GDP deflator, and PPI (2013â€“2023)
2.State-wise inflation trends
3.Data sourced from RBI, IMF, NCAER, Monetary Policy Reports, etc.

ðŸ§® **Forecasting Model:**
1. Linear regression analysis using Excel
2. Core Inflation forecast based on GDP growth
3. Equation used:
Core Inflation = 4.474 + 0.144 Ã— GDP Growth
For FY 2023-24 (GDP = 6.5%), **forecasted inflation = 5.41%**
